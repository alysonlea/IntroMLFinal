# Intro to Machine Learning: Supervised Learning
## Final Project
I have used a data set containing the most streamed Spotify songs from 2023. There are three deliverables for this project:
- Jupyter Notebook showing the supervised learning problem description, EDA procedure, analysis, model building and training, results, and discussion.
- Video presentation of the work where I give an overview of the problem, procedures, and results
- This repository, where all deliverables will be stored
